# Sensor Placement Code for Piloting A Precision Landscape Irrigation Advisory System
## Project Sponsor: UW Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering

This code is created in conjunction with EE 497 at the University of Washington for the capstone project Piloting A Precision Landscape Irrigation Advisory System. This code utilizes a Geodatabase File exported from GIS software as a masking layer (so buildings are not included). The purpose of this code is to give ideas of sensor placement locations. It utilizes the elevation of the points to choose the indicies. Then it will choose places to put them. It is only a idea of possible locations.
